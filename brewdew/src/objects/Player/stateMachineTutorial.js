/* To implement a state machine for managing the Player class methods in the provided game script, you can introduce a state enum and a state machine object. The state machine will maintain the current state of the Player and handle transitions between states based on input and conditions. Each state will have its own update method responsible for executing the appropriate actions for that state.

Here's a breakdown of how to implement the state machine:

1. **Define a State Enum:**
   Create an enum to represent the possible states of the Player. For instance: */


   enum PlayerState {
       Idle,
       Moving,
       PickingUpItem
   }


/* 2. **Create a State Machine Class:**
   Create a class to manage the state machine. This class will have properties to store the current state, methods to transition between states, and update methods for each state. */


   class PlayerStateMachine {
       constructor() {
           this.currentState = PlayerState.Idle;
       }

       update(delta) {
           switch (this.currentState) {
               case PlayerState.Idle:
                   this.updateIdle(delta);
                   break;
               case PlayerState.Moving:
                   this.updateMoving(delta);
                   break;
               case PlayerState.PickingUpItem:
                   this.updatePickingUpItem(delta);
                   break;
           }
       }

       transitionTo(newState) {
           this.currentState = newState;
       }

       // Update methods for each state
       updateIdle(delta) {
           // Handle idle state logic
       }

       updateMoving(delta) {
           // Handle moving state logic
       }

       updatePickingUpItem(delta) {
           // Handle picking up item state logic
       }
   }


/* 3. **Integrate State Machine into Player Class:**
   In the `Player` class, create a `stateMachine` property to hold the state machine instance and use it to manage the Player's behavior.
 */

   class Player extends GameObject {
       constructor(x, y) {
           super({
               position: new Vector2(x, y)
           });

           this.stateMachine = new PlayerStateMachine();

           // ... existing Player class logic
       }

       step(delta, root) {
           this.stateMachine.update(delta);

           // ... existing Player class step logic
       }
   }


/* With this approach, you can effectively manage the Player's behavior using a state machine, separating the behavior logic into distinct states and handling transitions between them. This promotes code organization and maintainability. */
